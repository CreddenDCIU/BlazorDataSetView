# BlazorDataSetView
This is a simple report view component I created for a few of our internal web applications. When I get time I'd like to include some examples of how it's used in this project so it's a bit more clear regarding how that's done. For now, though, good luck!

## What's Next

The plan, currently, is to build out support for in-line editing as well as per-column filtering.
